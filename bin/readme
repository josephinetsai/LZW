in constructor: use scanner, 
runs lzw on the input file, outputs an array of string called 'outputString'ie. a,b,c,ab,ca,abca,bacb,etc.

in compress:
converts 'outputString' into corresponding ascii values: 97,98,98,256,258, etc. called outputInts
changes 'outputString' into that array of Stringbinaries based on outputInts using Integer.toBinaryString
uses BinaryOut class to output a binary.dat file based on output

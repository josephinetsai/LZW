use scanner, creates a String that is the input file 
runs lzw on the input file, outputs an array of string ie. a,b,c,ab,ca,abca,bacb,etc. called output
converts array into 97,98,98,256,258, etc. called output 1 
changes output 1 into that array binaries based on output1
uses BinaryOut class to output a binary.dat file based on output
decode uses the ArrayList<Integers> to recreate the dictionary
decodes the array list and prints out the decoded string
